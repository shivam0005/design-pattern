# 🎯 Intent

    Convert the interface of a class into another interface the client expects.

In short: Make incompatible things work together.


# 🧠 Real-Life Analogy

* A laptop with only USB-C port needs an HDMI adapter to connect to a projector.
* The projector expects HDMI, but you give it a USB-C to HDMI adapter.


# ❓ When to Use Adapter?

* You want to reuse existing classes but their interfaces don’t match.
* You are integrating with legacy or 3rd-party systems.
