# üéØ Intent

    Create new objects by copying (cloning) an existing object, instead of 
    creating it from scratch every time.


# ‚ùì When to Use Prototype?

* Object creation is expensive (deep configuration, heavy initialization)
* You need many similar objects with slight changes 
* You want to decouple the code from the actual new keyword


# üß† Real-Life Analogy

Think of making photocopies of a document instead of rewriting it from scratch.

* Original = Prototype
* Copies = Clones (modified if needed)


# üì¶ Java Support: Cloneable + clone()

Java has built-in support via:

* Cloneable marker interface (no methods)
* Object.clone() (protected method)

But it's not perfect, so we often:

* Define our own clone() or copy() method
* Or use copy constructors / custom deep-copy logic
